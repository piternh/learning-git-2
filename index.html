		<p>Last Christmas 
		I gave you my heart 
		But the very next day 
		You gave it away 
		This year 
		To save me from tears 
		I'll give it to someone special.</p>
	
		<p>Last Christmas 
		I gave you my heart 
		But the very next day 
		You gave it away (you gave it away)
		This year

		<p>Once bitten and twice shy 
		I keep my distance 
		But you still catch my eye 
		Tell me baby 
		Do you recognize me? 
		Well 
		It's been a year 
		It doesn't surprise me 

		(Merry Christmas) 

		I wrapped it up and sent it 
		With a note saying "I love you" 
		I meant it 
		Now I know what a fool I've been 
		But if you kissed me now 
		I know you'd fool me again
